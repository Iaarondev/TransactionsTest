            <p>
                Negroar Resilience is an initiative designed to empower individuals in the Negro community of Baton Rouge 
                by providing access to a professional kitchen and retail space. Our mission is to foster independence, resilience, 
                and success for entrepreneurs who lack the resources or certifications to start their food service businesses.
